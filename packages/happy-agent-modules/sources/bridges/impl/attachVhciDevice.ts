 * socket pair as its descriptor 3 and writes `port 3 devid speed`; the kernel keeps its own
 * reference to that end, and the daemon keeps the other. Nothing else is shared with the helper.
 *
 * Another program may take a port between reading the status and writing the attachment, which
 * the kernel refuses. The status is read again after any refusal: a port that is no longer free
 * was taken, and the next one is tried; a port that is still free was refused for the device.
